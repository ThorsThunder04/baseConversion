# baseConversion
This file containes a few funtions that convert decimal, base8 and base16 to binary (base2)
Also, comments are in french because I had to do this as a project for school.


``binToDec()`` takes a binary value in a list ie: [1,1,0,1]. And then returns the decimal of that number.

``decToBinLst()`` takes a decimal value (type: int) and returns it in binary in the form of a list.
``decToBinStr()`` same functionality as ``dectoBinLst()`` but returns it in a string.

``octToBin()`` takes a base8 value (type: int) and then returns it in binary in the form of a string.

``hexToBin()`` takes a base16 value (type: str) and then returns it in binary in the form of a string.
